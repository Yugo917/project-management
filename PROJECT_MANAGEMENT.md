# Project Management

## Agile methodology

### Tools
- One shared TODO list 
    - each team member can add his todos or wishs about the project 
    - those todos will be converted in backlog entries after the "ToDoList review"
- One Kanban tool : to create the sprint with the binded task 
    - each task can have 3 status (todo, inProgress, done)
    - the done status is set when the feature is delivered in production
- Sprint on 2 weeks with severals ceremonies
    - TODO List review
    - Support Turning Role
    - Retrospective
    - Tri Weekly (3 daily per week) (notify the sprint progression and the support news)
    - Workshops
    - Backlog Refinement
